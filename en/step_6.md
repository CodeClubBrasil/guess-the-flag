## Choose a correct answer

Now that we have a list containing six chosen flags, let's choose which of them will be the correct answer this time.

+ Create a new variable called **Correct answer**

+ After you have chosen the six flags, set the 'Correct answer' variable to be a random item from the 'Chosen flags' list.

Add your code here:

You can use the same block as we used before:

![Pick item from list](images/item-from-list.png)

However, you will need to change the drop down to choose a random item rather than a specific item number.
