## Challenge: Improve the game

+ Add a fixed number of rounds and then tell the player their % of correct answers

+ Store the player's high score

[[[generic-scratch-high-score]]]

+ Add a timer for each round to force the player to click on their answer quickly

+ Add more flags to make the game more challenging

+ If the player clicks on an incorrect flag, remove that flag and allow them another chance to click on a different flag instead of starting the next round

+ Make the game into a two player game where players take it in turns to guess and have their scores recorded separately
