+ Click on the flag sprite and then click on the **Costumes** tab. You will see a blank flag template. Create 9 duplicate costumes of the blank flag template, so you have 10 flags in total.

+ Now we will draw the flags. Click on costume 1 and add the name of a country as the costume name.

+ Use the drawing tools to draw that country's flag.

You can use the circle tool for circles, the rectangle tool to draw stripes and the line tool to draw more complicated shapes like stars. Fill in any blank areas with the fill bucket tool. If you make a mistake, use the undo button to remove it.

+ Draw another 9 flags so that you have 10 different flag 'costumes' in total. Make sure that the name of each costume is the name of the country whose flag is displayed.

Here are the costumes we chose, but you can choose any flags you like for your game
