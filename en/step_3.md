+ Click on the flag sprite and then click on the **Costumes** tab. You will see a blank flag template. Create 9 duplicate costumes of the blank flag template, so you have 10 flags in total.

+ Now we will draw the flags. Click on costume 1 and add the name of a country as the costume name.

+ Use the vector drawing tools to draw that country's flag. Make sure your drawing is exactly the same size as the flag template.

For example, you can draw the flag for Italy by drawing three equally sized rectangles using the rectangle tool. Position them using the selection tool.

You could easily create a similar flag by duplicating this costume but changing the colours. For example, to draw the flag for Belgium, duplicate the Italy flag, then use the fill bucket to fill each rectangle with a different colour.

+ Draw another 9 flags so that you have exactly 10 different flag 'costumes' in total. Make sure that the name of each costume is the name of the country whose flag is displayed.

Here are the costumes we chose, but you can choose any flags you like for your game
